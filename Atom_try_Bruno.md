# LET'S HAVE A TRY AT ATOM

###The point of this document is to try atom, and get used to it.

Let's try atom. *Why?* Because:
  + It's new
  + It looks pretty good
  + It seems fun, although maybe not that convenient
  + It helps us render the .md files on GitHub
  + I just wanted to create a list so let's stop here

Let's now order the reason with respect to there importance
  1. It helps us render the .md files
  2. It looks pretty good
  3. It seems fun, at least because:
      * I like to code
      * I like the interface
      * It's another way to get better at GitHub
  4. It's new

I have no idea what a backtick is so here it goes:
There is a literal ``backtick (`)`` here

Let's have a try at the code blocks, in the example of GitHub:

    $ git pull
    $ git add "this is a new file"
    $ git status
    $ git commit -m "i just added a new file"
    $ git push

Let's try to confirm it:

      j'ecris du caca
      encore du caca


Another method:

```

$ git pull
$ git add "this is a new file"
$ git status
$ git commit -m "i just added a new file"
$ git push
```

Let's try to put a link to [GitHub](https://github.com/ "title?")

Oh and here is a picture

Let's try to see what happens if we put some code in the middle of a sentence:

You can always start with updating your Git file on your PC, with the command `$ git pull `, this brings everything non up to date to your PC.
