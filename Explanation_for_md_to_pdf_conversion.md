Conversion from .md to .pdf
=========================
Situation
--------------
Okay, guys, here it is. At the moment, we were, with Vincent, trying to understand how **Atom** is functioning. We got it pretty much figured out, it's **super simple**. But now is the ***Why?***
Because being able to make some fancy spam was not sufficient enough a reason for us, we tried to see how to use the preview. Also because it actually looks nice.
So I eventually found one solution to convert it to PDF.

Method
------------
Again, nothing complicated. The idea is
  1. Create your file on Atom using all the method described in the web pages we found
  2. Make it look real nice
  3. Save it, as "name.md"
  4. Go to <http://www.markdowntopdf.com/>
  5. Upload the .md file you proudly created
  6. Download and enjoy

Conclusion
-------------
Frankly, I don't really know were this tool comes from, but it actually is a pretty nice interface, and enables us to quickly create nice documents.
So let's use it, for personal purposes, but also of course to save the meeting minutes and other documents properly, and in a fancy way.

Further Idea
---------------
As we are going to read a lot of stuff, in particular paper, if I recall well what the teacher said, I propose to create a .md template of paper review, that would permit a quick data collection, and more importantly, an easy use of the other's work.
Easier to read reviews if all the info are collected in the same way, and similarely displayed. Would permit gain of time, focus and energy, I think.
