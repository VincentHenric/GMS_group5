 **STUDENT REPORT**

 *30 min: arrival of everyone, discussion about the articles*


  * modification of Mostafa's article


 *30 min : discussion about the bibliography*


  * how to put the bibliography in place, manage QR codes and reference?
  * One QR code will be put for each chapter of the IAR; it will link to a page with all the references relevant to this chapter
  * In the IAR, a bibliography with the main references will be organized in different paragraphs according to the chapters
  * a last QR code will link to a webpage of a global bibliography with the same layout as the final bibliography in the book
  * we also need to think about the direct quotes:numbers should be put in the book, linking to the corresponding reference
  * layar: problem of price: one page is 3â‚¬. We need to budget it

  *60 min : discussion about the next objectives*


  * We wait a little bit to make the topic part match the book layout
  * We focus on the last big part, which is the relevant factors and strategy (see mindmap)
  * This part's philosophy is to identify the most important parameters one should think about when talking about this market. They will support the strategy, which will be the conclusion of each part of this chapter
  * In this part, we now especially focus on a subcategory which will be about the global external factors. We have already listed a few through brainstorming:
      * oil price
      * battery price
      * electricity price
      * Kyoto protocol and international agreement on environment
      * substitution market
      * user acceptance (size car, shape,..)
      * universities/academic
      * economy conditions and promise for future
  * Of course, this list should be completed and organized better to do deeper investigations
  * We also considered that, as a big part of the report has just been finished, we should improve the logic model. It has not been done for a long time and will help to continue the IAR
  * to idea of making a website has also been evoked


**Assignments**


 * start searching about the global context categories. Everyone needs to get 2 relevant documents on each topic. The reference should be written in the document already created in the Global context folder.
 * think of new global context categories, alert everyone about them and give documents as well
 * everyone reads all the case studies and identify what is relevant to his own topic (regulations, zoning, market, technologies). It will give new ideas for the topic part
 * logic model: try to think and improve the logic model. It is very important

 * the assignment: put parts ready to be put in the report (layout), will be delayed for the moment. We wait that the case studies are put in the IAR, because maybe there will be changes about the layout requirements.

 **Program of next Monday**


 * discussion about the research of global context
 * grouping global context ideas in categories and distribution of the work
 * prepare the logic model for the next presentation
