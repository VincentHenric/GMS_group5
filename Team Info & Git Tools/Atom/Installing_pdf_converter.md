######This post is about converting the .md to pdf. Because that's nice.

------------------------------------

------------------------------------

I foud out there is a simple way to export .md docs in pdf. A *package* actually exists. It is called: **markdown-pdf**.

All you need to do is:
  1. File>Settings
  2. Click on "+Install"
  3. Type in "markdown-pdf" and press Enter
  4. Click on "Install" on the first research result (which should be markdown-pdf)
  5. This is it

After this, the package should be installed. All you have to do now is to create or open a .md file, and:
  1. Packages>Markdown to PDF (last button)> Convert
  2. Enjoy\*
  3. Go to the folder where lays the .md file. Now there also is a .pdf. It's aaaaaall yours.
  4. Open it and cry with joy

\* When I say enjoy, I mean that Atom automatically creates the pdf in the same branch as the .md file. So you should see it appear on the tree (left part of the interface).
