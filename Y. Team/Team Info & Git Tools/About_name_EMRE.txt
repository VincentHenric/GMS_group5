TO FIND OUT WHAT IS OUR NAME
We dont need to choose a name that must realted to our product I guess.
But I think it would be better to have one related to IoT.
And ofcourse Global Manufacturing Strategy.  
Thats why I checked some text about these topics and try to get some key words 
for helping us to find name. I can list key words that I choose like this: 

Internet - Things
Intelligence
Smart
Smart Planet (asmarterplanet.com IBM )
embedded electronics
connectivity
Autonomus
Data 
Information 
Knowledge
global
golobal data
strategy
high-tech
info-tech

We may create a name with these words I think by adding, combining and so on. 

As a story:
Today computers -- and, therefore, the Internet -- are almost wholly dependent on 
human beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes 
(a petabyte is 1,024 terabytes) of data available on the Internet were 
first captured and created by human beings by typing, pressing a record button,
 taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code. 

The problem is, people have limited time, attention and accuracy -- 
all of which means they are not very good at capturing data about things 
in the real world. If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about 
things -- using data they gathered without any help from us -- 
we would be able to track and count everything and greatly reduce waste, 
loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, 
repairing or recalling and whether they were fresh or past their best.”

"According to Steve Leibson, who identifies himself as 
“occasional docent at the Computer History Museum,” 
the address space expansion means that we could 
“assign an IPV6 address to every atom on the surface of the earth, 
and still have enough addresses left to do another 100+ earths.”
